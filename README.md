# PeriodicWW_1D

Calculation of periodic non-linear water waves over finite depth using 
the Hamiltonian Coupled-Mode System (HCMS)

The function mainPropagation calculates the evolution of a steady travelling wave
or a perturbed wave 

Details on the numerical scheme can be found in:

Papoutsellis, thesis

Any comments and questions are welcome!


# Working Example
[comment]: <> (Running the [ITCMS.m](ITCMS.m) function in the Matlab Command Window (type ITCMS and press Enter) produces the IT corresponding to the $M_2$ tidal constituent with constant stratification $N=0.0015$ (1/s), Coriolis frequency $f = 0.0001$ (1/s). The amplitude of the horizontal barotropic current at infinity is $U_0 = 0.04$ (m/s). The depth at infinity is $3000$ m and the ridge has a criticality $0.8$ and relative height $0.5$. The calculated energy conversion rate is $1577.26$ (W/m) per unit ridge length. We give below typical plots (baroclinic stream function and horizontal velocity) and a video produced by the code:)
